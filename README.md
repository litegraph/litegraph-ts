[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-ts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-ts)

TypeScript/AssemblyScript library for writing sublitegraph mappings to be
deployed to [The LiteGraph](https://github.com/litegraph/litegraph-node).

## Usage

For a detailed guide on how to create a sublitegraph, please see the
[LiteGraph CLI docs](https://github.com/litegraph/litegraph-cli).

One step of creating the subgraph is writing mappings that will process
blockchain events and will write entities into the store. These mappings
are written in TypeScript/AssemblyScript.

The `litegraph-ts` library provides APIs to access the LiteGraph Node store,
blockchain data, smart contracts, data on IPFS, cryptographic functions
and more. To use it, all you have to do is add a dependency on it:

```sh
npm install --dev litegraph-ts # NPM
yarn add --dev litegraph-ts    # Yarn
```

After that, you can import the `store` API and other features from
this library in your mappings. A few examples:

```typescript
import { store, crypto } from 'litegraph-ts'

// This is just an example event type generated by `litegraph-cli`
// from an Lite smart contract ABI
import { NameRegistered } from './types/abis/SomeContract'

// This is an example of an entity type generated from a
// sublitegraph's LiteGraphQL schema
import { Domain } from './types/schema'

function handleNameRegistered(event: NameRegistered) {
  // Example use of a crypto function
  let id = crypto.keccak256(name).toHexString()

  // Example use of the generated `Entry` class
  let domain = new Domain()
  domain.name = name
  domain.owner = event.params.owner
  domain.timeRegistered = event.block.timestamp

  // Example use of the store API
  store.set('Name', id, entity)
}
```

## Helper Functions for AssemblyScript

Refer to the `helper-functions.ts` file in this repository for a few common functions that help build on top of the AssemblyScript library, such as byte array concatenation, among others. 

## API

Documentation on the API can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/assemblyscript-api#api-reference).

For examples of `graph-ts` in use take a look at one of the following subgraphs:
